# Project Synapse ðŸ§ 

**Project Synapse is a high-performance, cost-optimized serverless platform for LLM inference on AWS.**

This project tackles the critical challenges of high latency and low GPU utilization in traditional serverless deployments. By implementing a custom Go-based workload manager, it enables intelligent request batching and worker pooling to drastically reduce costs and achieve production-grade P99 latencies.

## Core Architecture

The system uses a decoupled, asynchronous architecture to ensure scalability and resilience. For a detailed view, see the full diagram and design documents linked below.

## ## Step 2: Commit and Push the Changes

Now, save the updated file to your Git history.

1.  In your VS Code terminal, add the changes:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
2.  Commit the file with a clear message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "docs: update README with links to design documents"
    ```
3.  Push the changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
